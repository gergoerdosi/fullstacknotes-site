**Fullstack Notes** is a curated digital garden, knowledge base, and cheatsheet collection for modern web development. It covers the entire stack—from frontend frameworks and CSS tricks to backend architecture and DevOps.

Built with performance in mind using [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/).

## 💡 Why This Matters

In the rapidly evolving landscape of software engineering, it is impossible to memorize every API, syntax quirk, or architectural pattern.

This repository serves as an **external second brain**. Unlike generic search results or AI-generated answers, these notes are context-aware, curated, and battle-tested. They bridge the gap between reading documentation and actually implementing a feature, providing a quick, trusted reference that saves valuable development time.
